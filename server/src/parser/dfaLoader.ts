/**
 * DFA Snapshot Loader — pre-populates the ANTLR4 parser's static DFA
 * tables from a build-time snapshot for near-instant startup (~20 ms).
 *
 * Pre-seeded states use empty ATNConfigSets as a safety fallback.
 * When the parser encounters a token sequence not in the snapshot,
 * the SLL fast path bails out and the LL fallback computes correct
 * transitions from the ATN.  This means the DFA self-heals:
 *   - Covered paths → instant (pre-seeded edges)
 *   - Uncovered paths → one-time LL computation (~50-200 ms per decision)
 *   - Subsequent parses → all paths fast
 *
 * The "pre-seeded" flag is cleared after the first self-heal event
 * to prevent redundant retry loops.
