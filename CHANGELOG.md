# Changelog

## [0.15.0]

### Added

- View filter, rendering, and expose target extraction in the symbol table
- View specialization chain resolution — views inherit filters, rendering, and expose targets from parent view defs
- Viewpoint satisfaction validation rule: warns when a view has no expose or filter directives
- Standard library view types (`GeneralView`, `InterconnectionView`, `TabularRendering`, etc.) recognised by the semantic validator
- Grammar: metadata cast expression `(as MetadataType)` in `baseExpression`
- `viewFilters` and `viewRendering` attributes surfaced in the model DTO

### Changed

- Unused-definition rule now considers expose targets as references
- Keyword-truncation regex in type-name extraction requires uppercase boundary to avoid false matches inside identifiers like `InterconnectionView`
- Lint fixes: replaced `any` casts with proper types, removed unused imports and variables

## [0.14.0]

### Added

- Expose target extraction for view usages and view definitions in the symbol table
- Markdown benchmark reporter for human-readable result summaries
- Expose targets surfaced as element attributes in the model DTO

### Changed

- CI skips runs on markdown-only changes (`paths-ignore: '**/*.md'`)
- Keyword-truncation regex uses negative lookbehind to avoid matching mid-identifier

## [0.13.0]

### Added

- Comprehensive benchmark framework (`benchmarks/`) with 6 suites: parse, symbolTable, providers, memory, throughput, folderLoad — includes CLI runner, JSON baselines, and regression detection
- Dependabot configuration for weekly npm and GitHub Actions dependency updates
- Security audit step (`npm audit --audit-level=high`) in CI pipeline
- Configurable `sysml.scan.skipDirectories` setting for workspace scanning

### Changed

- Symbol table: O(1) `inferKind()` via `ruleIndex` lookup maps, binary-search `findSymbolAtPosition()`, reverse-index `findReferences()`, cached `getAllSymbols()`
- Batch parsing with shared lexer/parser singletons; token stream reuse on SLL→LL fallback
- Workspace scanning redesigned as 3-phase async pipeline: concurrent discovery → batched file I/O → sequential batch parse
- Provider caching: SemanticTokens (URI+version), DiagnosticsProvider (grammar ranges), CompletionProvider (array identity), SemanticValidator (symbol names, library names, line-offset binary search)
- HoverProvider uses cached diagnostics only — no longer triggers full validation on hover
- Parse worker builds visible token array once, shared across all post-parse analysis
- Removed dead `scanWorkspaceFolder` function and superseded `scripts/benchmark-parse.ts`
- Security: updated `hono` to fix HTML injection via JSX attribute names (GHSA-458j-xx4x-4375)
- Enforced consistent LF line endings via `.gitattributes`
- Build artifacts and Python cache excluded from version control

## [0.12.0]

### Added

- Parse performance benchmark script (`scripts/benchmark-parse.ts`) for cold vs DFA-pre-seeded comparisons
- Async workspace scanning with post-scan revalidation of open documents

### Changed

- Workspace file scanning now only runs for `.code-workspace` projects, avoiding wasteful scans in single-file mode
- Completion provider caches definition completions per document version
- Hover provider shares the server-level semantic validator to reuse cached indexes
- Semantic validator caches symbol indexes across validation runs
- Parse worker improved DFA snapshot retry and re-parse logic
- Diagnostics line numbers clamped to prevent negative values from error listener
- Workspace scan skips `temp`, `test`, `dist`, `build`, and similar non-project directories

## [0.11.0]

### Added

- Cross-file requirement diagnostics: `satisfy` and `verify` checks now use workspace-wide model relationships instead of per-file text scanning (#10)
- Narrowed diagnostics suppression: syntax errors are only suppressed in blocks containing expression operators the grammar cannot parse (#8)
- Integration test suite covering keyword derivation, suppression narrowing, and end-to-end provider pipeline (#8)
- Regression tests for cross-file shorthand `satisfy`/`verify` (#10)

### Changed

- `stripComments()` consolidated into shared `identUtils.ts` — removed duplicates from model provider and semantic validator
- Keyword set derived from generated ANTLR lexer at runtime, replacing hardcoded list in symbol table (#8)
- `RelationshipDTO.source` is now optional for shorthand `satisfy`/`verify` without `by` clause
- Satisfy/verify caches populated in a single workspace scan instead of redundant passes
- Grammar and DFA snapshot updated
- Cascading `}` error suppression scoped to closing line of suppressed blocks only (#8)

### Fixed

- False `unsatisfied-requirement` / `unverified-requirement` warnings when models are split across files (#10)
- Expression operators inside comments no longer falsely trigger diagnostics suppression
- Security: updated dependencies to resolve 7 CVEs (lodash, vite, hono, path-to-regexp, picomatch, brace-expansion)

## [0.10.0]

### Added

- Off-main-thread parsing via worker thread — diagnostics arrive faster while hover/completion stay responsive
- Early-open document queue: files opened before server initialisation are re-validated once the DFA is ready
- Enum value recognition (`enum red;` and bare `red;`) modelled as `EnumUsage` children in the symbol table
- DFA loader module for worker-side snapshot hydration
- Expanded warm-up text with `import` and `import all` variants

### Changed

- Parse-retry comment trimmed to a concise one-liner
- `empty-enum` diagnostic no longer fires when the enum body contains explicit or implicit values

### Fixed

- False-positive syntax errors on `import` statements inside package bodies

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- Semantic rules: circular specialization, circular containment, unsatisfied requirements, unverified requirements
- Syntax error suppression for known grammar limitation zones (constraint bodies, calc/analysis expressions)
- Workspace file scanning improvements
- Document formatting provider

### Changed

- Parser self-healing DFA: SLL→LL fallback builds correct DFA states in-place instead of clearing the entire snapshot
- Library index handles `<shortName>` and quoted long-name syntax
- Satisfy/verify caches on `SemanticValidator` avoid redundant workspace scans
- Type-name extraction strips leaked keyword concatenations from `getText()`

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- Update grammar files with Full OMG SysML v2 spec conformance: grammar now passes all official training, validation, and example files (309 .sysml files across 4 suites)
- `make update-grammar` now automatically rebuilds parser and regenerates DFA snapshot
- Standard library smoke test retained in LSP repo (`test/unit/conformance.test.ts`)

### Changed

- Grammar updated with conformance fixes: `endOccurrenceUsageElement` named ends, `unreservedKeyword` for 14 keywords used as names in OMG standard library, `//*..*/` block comment support, `REF` in body expressions, prefix metadata on enum members, `send` without inline payload, `actionNodeMember` reordering, `REGULAR_COMMENT` in expressions, `definitionBodyItem` in `functionBodyPart`
- `update-grammar` Makefile target now sources grammar from `daltskin/sysml-v2-grammar` (was `daltskin/grammars-v4`)

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Workspace-wide semantic validation with cross-file symbol indexes (byName, byParent, byQualifiedName, definitionsByName, portsByName)
- Three new validation rules: redefinition multiplicity, port type compatibility, constraint body references
- Quick-fix code actions for all three new rules (align multiplicity, switch port endpoint, suggest nearest member)
- Context-aware completions: port endpoints in `connect` blocks, type annotation filtering, workspace definition symbols
- Semantic feedback in hover tooltips — shows diagnostics and repair hints at the hovered position
- Cached semantic diagnostics per document version to avoid redundant revalidation
- MCP preview tool falls back to cached/loaded documents when `code` parameter is omitted

### Changed

- Unused-definition rule narrowed to PartDef/ActionDef, excludes types with base types, promoted from Hint to Warning, now workspace-scoped
- Grammar updated to OMG "2026-02 - SysML v2 Release" — removed local `end <keyword>` patch in favour of upstream `endFeatureUsage` rule
- MCP non-visual tools annotated with explicit "NOT Visualization" routing guidance
- MCP preview response stripped to minimal render data (mermaidMarkup + title)
- MCP tool routing guidance and aliases expanded for diagnostics, validation, and file-focused preview requests

### Fixed

- Semantic validator signal quality: reduced specialization false positives and downgraded low-value unused-definition reports to warnings
- Document-close diagnostics race: pending validation timers are cancelled and diagnostics publishing is guarded for closed documents

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Shared utilities: `identUtils.ts` for identifier handling, `symbolKindMapping.ts` for LSP SymbolKind mapping
- Keywords now derived from ANTLR grammar at runtime — no manual list to maintain
